# Should I Go App
> Should-I-Go provides you with the information on visitor density in popular places. Connected to a Google API tracking live phone data, our app can answer the following questions for you:

- What is the best time to go to *public place?*
- How is the visitation density at *public place* right now?
- If *public place* is crowded, what alternatives do I have, that are currently less crowded?
